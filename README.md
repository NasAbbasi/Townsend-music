Townsend-music Test Project
I have produced this project using pure PHP which has both client-side validations using jQuery and server-side validation using a built-in library. for the database part, I have used MySQL to connect to the database and make the query. I also put the SQL extension of the table in the root.
For the mail part, unfortunately, I didn't get the exact structure. So I create a mail class based on my conception using built-in PHP mail function which cannot be connected to the SMPT from local. It has the other part like CSRF protection and inserting in database.
